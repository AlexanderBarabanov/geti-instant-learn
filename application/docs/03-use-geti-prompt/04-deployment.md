# Deployment

> This section is under development

Once the prompted model meets the user’s performance requirements, the user can deploy the Geti Prompt application, including the prompted model, in different ways: as a containerized Docker image for deployment on remote edge servers and devices, or run the application & model directly on a local pc.

> TODO: include steps for each deployment option, and gifs/screenshots where applicable
