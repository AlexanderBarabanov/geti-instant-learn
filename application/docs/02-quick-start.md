# Quick Start Guide

Get your first zero-shot segmentation results in minutes.

## Installation

> **Note:** Pre-built binaries are not yet available. This section will be updated when container images are published to the registry. For now, build and run the application using Docker as described in the [Application README](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/instant-learn/blob/main/application/README.md).

Once running, access the application at `http://localhost:9100`

## Create Your First Project

1. **Create a project:** Click "Create Project" on the welcome screen
2. **Add input:** Select a sample dataset from the dropdown
3. **Capture an image:** Click through the dataset to find a good example
4. **Draw your prompt:** Use the annotation tool to select target objects and assign a label (e.g., coffee berries)
5. **Apply the prompt:** Click "Save Prompt" to instruct the model
6. **View results:** Navigate through the dataset to see zero-shot predictions

The default PerDINO model runs automatically on all images using your visual prompt.
