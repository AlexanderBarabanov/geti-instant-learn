# Inference

> This section is under development

Once the model of choice has been prompted, Geti Instant Learn processes the provided prompt against the visual input stream. This enables users to quickly evaluate the model’s performance based on the provided prompts.

## Live View

The Live View will now show the inference results as an overlay on top of the input data.

> TODO: include Live View options/gif to show how the output visualization looks like

## Output Configuration

The user can configure how the generated model output should be stored or consumed. The user can set a destination of choice and configure the predictions format, as well as define the inference rate of choice.

> TODO: include the different output destination & prediction options, with gif to show how this works and how the stored output looks like as an example
