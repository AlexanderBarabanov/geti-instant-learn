    A thread-safe class to broadcast frames to multiple consumers.

    It manages a queue for each registered consumer. If a consumer's
    queue is full the oldest frame is dropped to make space for the new one.

    The live nature of WebRTC streams requires consumers to be registered and unregistered dynamically as they connect
    and disconnect. If we were to share a single queue for all consumers, they would compete for frames, effectively
    stealing them from each other. This broadcaster ensures every consumer gets its own queue.
